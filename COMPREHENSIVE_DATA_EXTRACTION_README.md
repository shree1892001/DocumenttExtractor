    source_file="document.txt"
)

# Get summary
summary = extractor.get_extraction_summary(result)
print(f"Document Type: {summary['document_type']}")
print(f"Total Fields: {summary['total_fields']}")

# Search for specific fields
search_results = extractor.search_fields(result, "phone")
print(f"Found {search_results['total_matches']} phone-related fields")
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Upload file for comprehensive extraction
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9500/api/v1/comprehensive-extraction" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"

# Process text directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9500/api/v1/comprehensive-extraction/text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your document text here..."}'

# Search extracted data
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9500/api/v1/comprehensive-extraction/search" \
